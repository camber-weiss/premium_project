        <p class="quote">“I’ve been seeing Phish since 2009, but started listening to their music towards the end of high school (’05/’06). 
            I’ve mostly lived in the southeast for the last ten years, and while I feel like Phish absolutely throws down when they come to this area, 
            during those early years of fandom I didn’t always have the funds or job flexibility — 
            to pause my life and travel around catching as many ‘away’ shows as I would have liked to. 
            Sometimes it’s hard to not feel envious of the people who are at every damn show. 
            I would find myself SO bummed about not seeing more than one show a summer — and during one particularly rough, broke year, 
            I wasn’t able to make it to any shows at all. 
            More recent years have changed my situation when it comes to how many shows I can justify hitting per year, 
            but sometimes I still get down when I miss certain shows. But… I’ve been trying to turn those thoughts around.<br><br>

            There is nothing else in my life that gives me the type of FOMO that missing a Phish show does — 
            but I’ve also come to realize there are very few other things in life that make me feel so fulfilled, grateful, 
            and even sometimes emotional as a crazy good show — the type that has you riding that wave of bliss well after it ends. 
            Friday night of Charleston was that for me. After that show ended, I truly felt so content and happy, I couldn’t stop smiling. 
            That’s why I go see this band whenever I can. I’m grateful for the shows I’ve been to (and I’ve been to some good ones 🙂), 
            but I’m really, really trying my hardest to not compare my situation to anyone else’s, and simply be grateful for the times 
            that I’ve had seeing my favorite band. Riding that wave — for as long as i can, as often as i can!”<br><br>
