        <p class="quote">“I grew up lucky to have a family with an awesome taste in music. 
            Credit definitely goes to my Aunt Chrissy for introducing me to Phish. 
            I vividly remember sneaking into her CD collection and ‘borrowing’ A Picture of Nectar. 
            I listened to that album on my portable CD player for days on end, even on the elementary school bus. 
            Flash-forward fifteen years later, and here I am — headed to Charleston for the three-day run without any tickets. 
            Given the help of a friend with some solid design skills, we were able to whip up this poster and land a few tickets for Saturday night. 
            These things don’t just happen with any band… but with Phish, things always seem to fall into place.“<br><br>
